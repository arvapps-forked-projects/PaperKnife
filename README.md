## Download

Get the latest APK: [PaperKnife v1.1.0](https://github.com/potatameister/PaperKnife/releases/latest)

- **Full** (GitHub releases): everything, including offline OCR.
- **Lite** (IzzyOnDroid): same app without the OCR engine — smaller download.

[<img src="https://gitlab.com/IzzyOnDroid/repo/-/raw/master/assets/IzzyOnDroidButtonGreyBorder_nofont.png" height="80" alt="Get it at IzzyOnDroid">](https://apt.izzysoft.de/packages/com.paperknife.app)

Or use the [live site](https://potatameister.github.io/PaperKnife/) — installable as a PWA for offline access.

## Run the web version locally

Requirements: **Node.js 22+** and `git`. Everything below runs on your own machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/potatameister/PaperKnife.git
cd PaperKnife
npm ci                  # install dependencies (also used by CI)
npm run vendor:ocr      # optional, only needed for Deep OCR (one-time)
npm run dev             # start the local server (http://localhost:3000)
```

Notes:
*   `npm run vendor:ocr` is **optional** — skip it and everything works except Deep OCR. The engine files (~30 MB) are never committed to git, so a fresh clone cannot do OCR until you run it. Re-running later is safe — it skips what is already there.
*   `npm run build` produces a static `dist/` folder you can serve with any static host (`npm run preview` to check it locally). No server component exists — it is plain files.
*   To build the Android APK yourself, you additionally need JDK 21 + Android SDK, then `npx cap sync android` after `npm run build`. The OCR files (if vendored) are bundled into the full APK automatically.
